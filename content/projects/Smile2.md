This second iteration moves on from classification to attempting to transform non-smiling faces into smiling ones. It uses a much larger dataset (nearly 14,000 images) and integrates generative modeling (CycleGAN) to transform non-smiling faces into smiling ones. The model is then evaluated using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID).
